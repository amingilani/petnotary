    %p.lead
      After founding a few startups myself, I've realized something really needs to be automated:
      = succeed '.' do
        %strong People Ops
    %ul.text-left.small
      %li
        %em People:
        founders, employees (full-time, and part-time), contractors, sub-contractors, staff, etc.
      %li
        %em Ops:
        agreements, contracts, compensation plans, performance, reviews, etc.
    %p.lead
      %strong Help
      me
      %strong fix
      this tedious, oft-laborous task and I'll give you a
      = succeed '.' do
        %strong present
    %ul.text-left.small
      %li
        %em Help:
        Fill out a small survey to help me get data on what to build.
      %li
        %em Fix:
        Design a tool free for the vast majority of small startups and businesses to handle People Ops.
      %li
        %em Present:
        I'll invite you to the beta. It'll be free for the vast majority of my small users?
